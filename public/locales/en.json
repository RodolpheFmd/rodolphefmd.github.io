By leveraging Sparrow, the first but not the least breakthrough solver, we provide highly scalable, cloud-hosted safety net designed to resolve complex conflicts in real-time.","p2":"Our goal is to bridge the gap between academic excellence and industrial reality, reducing operator workload and facilitating a safe, transparent transition toward the future of digital aviation."},"safetyNet":{"title":"What is a Safety Net ?","p1":"Aviation is the safest mode of transportation. As we introduce new operations in low-level airspace over urban, suburban, and rural areas, we must not only comply with this standard but improve it.","p2":"Safety nets play a major role after departure in preventing imminent or actual hazardous situations. They are a critical link in the global safety chain. In current Air Traffic Management, systems like the Short-Term Conflict Alert support controllers by warning of potential conflicts.","p3":"Augmented takes this further. We are developing a tool that does not just alert, but actively proposes solutions up to 2 minutes before hazards. Designed for increasingly complex environments, it features a real-time interface with trajectory preview to ensure total situational awareness."},"timeline":{"conflictDetection":{"title":"Conflict Detection","desc":"Continuous monitoring of trajectories to identify potential separation losses up to 2 minutes before a potential hazard. Data are filtered and compared with previous states to minimise false alerts and maximise both conflict detection accuracy."},"process":{"title":"Process","desc":"Sparrow computes conflict states in milliseconds, handling multiple global or localised encounters simultaneously. It aggregates data over a 25-second window to maintain detection and decision-making capabilities, even during traffic communication losses or brief service interruptions."},"decisionMaking":{"title":"Decision Making","desc":"Sparrow proposes a solution with visual support, a deconfliction preview, and humanly-sound instructions."},"instruction":{"title":"Instruction","desc":"Sparrow accounts for manoeuvre latency due to human cognition, decision-making, and instruction execution using an operational time window and a predictive trajectory cone. At any time, the user may resend a request and repeat the previous step."},"manoeuvre":{"title":"Manoeuvre","desc":"The user interface shows real-time deconfliction and the status of the conflict, in addition to monitoring any deviation from the decision."},"followup":{"title":"Follow-up<br><span style=\"font-size:0.8em; font-weight:normal;\">(Real-time Preview)</span>","desc":"Real-time confirmation of full conflict resolution."}},"forWhom":{"title":"For Whom?","hoverHint":"Hover over a point to learn more.","institutions":{"title":"Institutions","desc":"Supporting regulatory bodies with data-driven safety experience, recommendations, and policy validation."},"ats":{"title":"Air Traffic Services","desc":"Empowering future controllers with AI-driven conflict resolution for high-density traffic."},"academia":{"title":"Academia","desc":"Providing a benchmark for comparing new algorithms and high-performance simulation."},"labs":{"title":"Laboratories R&D","desc":"Complementing existing systems as a headless module for real-world experimentation."}},"whyAugmented":{"title":"Why Augmented?","subtitle":"Choose the best available solution for tactical conflict resolution in the extended airspace.","clickHint":"↓ Click for more details ↓","expertise":{"title":"Deep Expertise in AI/ML & Aviation Safety","h2":"Deep Expertise in AI/ML & Aviation","p":"Augmented is the maturation of four years of intensive innovation in AI/ML-based tactical conflict resolution for the next generation of air traffic management.

Our expertise extends across diverse advanced air traffic environments, focusing on the harmonisation and integration of digital solutions with existing legacy systems to ensure a safe transition for the industry."},"integrationFrH2":"Validation Opérationnelle & Intégration Système","performance":{"title":"Disruptive Performance","h2":"Disruptive Performance","p":"Augmented's solutions deliver unmatched performance by resolving simultaneous, multi-threat global and local conflicts in split seconds. While optimised for low-altitude operations, they masterfully navigate the diverse dynamics of General and Commercial Aviation, generating instructions that minimise manoeuvres. Built for extreme resilience, our platform excels in degraded data environments and maintains integrity even during connection losses of up to 30 seconds, also providing operators with real-time visual validation to ensure decisions are always up to date."},"validation":{"title":"Rigorous Design & Validation","h2":"Rigorous Design & Validation","p":"Augmented ensures separation assurance with a lookahead horizon of up to 2 minutes before potential hazardous proximity. Our AI/ML models are trained in rigorously validated environments and evaluated using performance metrics inspired by global standards (RTCA, ASTM, EUROCAE). We also harmonise our platform with future airborne solutions to avoid redundant or contradictory advisories. Beyond raw performance, we prioritise AI explainability to ensure transparency, while remaining vigilant and adaptive to the evolving regulatory landscape."},"simplicity":{"title":"Simplicity & Elegance behind Sophistication","h2":"Simplicity & Elegance behind Sophistication","p":"Augmented's interface is more than just intuitively designed; it is a testament to our belief that beauty and functionality are inseparable in safety-critical systems. We transform complex, high-density operations into beautifully streamlined tasks through a human-centric approach. By prioritising clarity and aesthetic precision, our platform reduces operator workload and mitigates cognitive stress, ensuring that the profound capabilities of our AI/ML are not only powerful but a joy to use; a real partner."},"openAccess":{"title":"Open Access & Community Innovation","h2":"Open Access & Community Innovation","p":"We are committed to democratising airspace safety.
